 # Motion detector Security System 
 The Project works as an system which gives you signal when there is some motion outside and and Led will blink and Buzzer inside will will alert you. The intial Project was the switching on of the LED when there is motion. The modification made was that Leds will start blinking and buzzer was added whih will make sound to alert. A LCD display Added to the project to display , if the motion was dectcted or not. I have also added a ultrasonic senser which will help to dected the distance when there is motion going on.![Final Project Picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72895806/101530726-e9a86f80-3957-11eb-98e9-5d7a756e3c0b.jpeg)
